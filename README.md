This is only for people who don't shy away from command prompts and a bit of coding.

Introduction
============

My collection of kOS scripts, copied, stolen and rewritten from various sources.

This is a collection / rework / bugfix / merge of scripts from various sources:

- xeger/kos-ramp (rovering, launches, landings, node executions, transfers etc)
- aidygus/astar-rover (pretty cool path finding algorithm for rovers)


Usage
============

Add a kOS core to your vessel, make sure it has the maximum amount of memory you can stick into it, set the boot file to boot.ks. That script will copy various programs and libraries onto your core, depending on your flight state and vessel type.

To launch, put your rocket onto the launch pad and type "run launch."
