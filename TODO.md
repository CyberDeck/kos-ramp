- troubleshoot landing
    - braking prediction is off ... why?

- integrate deorbit & landing
  - don't mess up trajectory; use different approach? e.g. positionat(perigee) vs terrain height?

- troubleshoot rendezvous/approach
    - rendezvous gets stuck on final approach

- warp during ascent is too frisky (wait till out of atmo)

- warp during landing
